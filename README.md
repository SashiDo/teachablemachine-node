The package empowers you to load any image classification model trained with Teachable Machine in a your SashiDo application.  

# Install

Each SashiDo application comes with a private GitHub repo that stores your server-side logic. Simply add the package to the package.json file of your project, you have two ways to go:

- Add the following line to your dependencies in the package.json
```
  "@sashido/teachablemachine-node": "1.0.0"

```
OR
 - Run the following command to your local project and then push changes to the SashiDo app's repo.

`npm install @sashido/teachablemachine-node`


# Usage

  modelUrl: "https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/kG5U1WBQe/"
});

model.classify({
  imageUrl: "https://cgtvm9ubnmtf2ckeqzvksppjgclcsk.files-sashido.cloud/9167d747f112142776f546815102e32b_1.png",

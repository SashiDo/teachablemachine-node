3. Pass the URL to SashiDo Teachable to load the model. Next, let it have the image URL and call `classify` to get the predictions.

# Example
```
const SashidoTeachable = require("@sashido/teachablemachine-node");

const model = new SashidoTeachable({
  modelUrl: "https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/kG5U1WBQe/"
});

model.classify({
  imageUrl: "https://cgtvm9ubnmtf2ckeqzvksppjgclcsk.files-sashido.cloud/9167d747f112142776f546815102e32b_1.png",

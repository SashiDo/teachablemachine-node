3. Pass the URL to SashiDoTeachable to load the model. Next, let it have the image URL and call `classify` to get the predictions.

### Play around with the model that SashiDo Team already trained.

SashiDo's team loves animals and it is no wonder that our first model was trained to recognize whether an image has a dog on it or no.As
ðŸ˜Š We've collected a dataset of more than 2000 images of dogs, cats, horses, other animals, people and everyday objects and uploaded them into two different classes into Teachable Machine. A big shoutout to [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) as a great plaform for free photos. Check it out in case you're just starting and do not have raw data yet.

You can load our **Dog <-> Not a Dog** model using the this URL and folloing the example below:

```

model.classify({
  imageUrl: "https://cgtvm9ubnmtf2ckeqzvksppjgclcsk.files-sashido.cloud/9167d747f112142776f546815102e32b_1.png",

2. Make sure that you select Tensorflow.js format when exporting. That way your model will be uploaded (for free) and you will receive an access URL.

3. Pass the URL to SashiDoTeachable to load the model. Next, let it have the image URL and call `classify` to get the predictions.

### Play around with the model that SashiDo Team already trained.

SashiDo's team loves animals and it is no wonder that our first model was trained to recognize whether an image has a dog on it or no.
ðŸ˜Š We've collected a dataset of more than 2000 images of dogs, cats, horses, other animals, people and everyday objects and uploaded them into two different classes with Teachable Machine.
